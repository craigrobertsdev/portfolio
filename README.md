## Motivation

This project was motivated by my need to have a place for potential Recruiters and Hiring Managers to go to check out my work. 

## Problem Solved

I now have a personal promotional page that will look good across all screen sizes. 

The links on the page are dummies at this stage as I have not built out any of the featured applications as yet. They will be updated over time as I commence and complete these projects.

## What I Learned
This project was particularly difficult for me as it was both my first experience with web design and the first time I've had to use a significant amount of CSS without having a template to assist.

The published product is a complete re-write of the inital plan. For the second attempt, I used Figma to create a wireframe of the current version of the full-sized page, and found great benefit in the ability to quickly modify color palettes and other layout aspects without having the clutter of actual HTML and CSS.

## Site Access
This site was built using Github Pages and can be found [here](https://craigrobertsdev.github.io/portfolio/)
