## Motivation

This project was motivated by my need to have a place for potential Recruiters and Hiring Managers to go to check out my work. 

## Problem Solved

I now have a personal promotional page that will look good across all screen sizes. 

The projects will be updated as I progress through the bootcamp and have more time to complete personal projects to showcase my skillset. 

## What I Learned
This project was particularly difficult for me as it was both my first experience with web design and the first time I've had to use a significant amount of CSS without having a template to assist.

The published product is a complete re-write of the inital plan. For the second attempt, I used Figma to create a wireframe of the current version of the full-sized page, and found great benefit in the ability to quickly modify color palettes and other layout aspects without having the clutter of actual HTML and CSS.

As of 16th March 2023, the portfolio is completely different to the first published version. JavaScript functionality has been added to enable both a responsive scroll indicator bar and hamburger menu at smaller screen sizes.
